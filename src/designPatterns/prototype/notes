1. interface with a generic -> clone()
2. Any class that needs to follow prototype -> implements the interface
3. write the clone() -> call a specific copy constructor which copies the set
of attributes will remain common across a lot of objects
4. use the clone() to create copies of the prototype

5. Maintain multiple prototypes of a class -> Registry -> class with a hashmap

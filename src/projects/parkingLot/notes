Tasks -
1. Create the parkingSpot type classes, EVParkingSpot etc.
2. Full fledged, class diagram for ParkingLot [hint -> if we can create the class diagram from the code]
3. Schema Design -> tables for the entities -> most important


BillCalculation logic ->
1. Base + Hourly -> base rate + number of hours * hourlyrate
2. Surge ->
    baseRate + (number of hours * hourlyrate) => amount
    total = amount + ( amount * surge )
    [ how much your parking lot is filled up ]
    surge -> 0.5 => 50% to 75%
    surge -> 0.75 => 75% to 90%
    surge -> 0.9 => 90% to 100%
